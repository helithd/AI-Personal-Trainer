# AI Trainer: Bicep Curl Rep Counter

Control your workout routine with an AI-powered trainer that counts your bicep curl reps in real-time using computer vision techniques!



## Description

This project is an AI-based trainer that counts the number of bicep curl repetitions you perform. The AI trainer uses a camera to track your arm movements and counts reps based on the angle of your arm during the exercise. The project is implemented using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Detecting Bicep Curl Reps

The AI trainer detects the following actions based on your arm's position and movement:

- **Start Position**: Arm extended.
- **Bicep Curl**: Arm curled towards your shoulder.
- **Rep Count**: Each full curl and return to start position is counted as one rep.
